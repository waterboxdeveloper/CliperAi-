# Dockerizing CLIPER

This document outlines the steps and considerations for deploying the CLIPER tool using Docker. Docker allows you to package CLIPER and its dependencies into a portable container, ensuring consistent execution across different environments.

## 1. Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

-   **Docker**: [Install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
-   **Docker Compose**: [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (usually comes with Docker Desktop)

## 2. Dockerfile

The `Dockerfile` defines the environment for your CLIPER application. It will include Python, system dependencies like FFmpeg, and your project's Python dependencies.

Create a file named `Dockerfile` in the root of your CLIPER project:

```dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.10-slim-buster

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Install system dependencies required by FFmpeg and WhisperX
# FFmpeg is crucial for video processing
# libmagic1 is needed by some Python packages (e.g., python-magic)
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    ffmpeg \
    libmagic1 && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Copy pyproject.toml and uv.lock first to leverage Docker cache
# uv.lock ensures reproducible builds
COPY pyproject.toml uv.lock ./

# Install Python dependencies using uv
# uv is recommended for its speed and lock file management
RUN pip install uv && \
    uv sync --system

# Copy the rest of your application code
COPY . .

# Expose any ports if your application had a web interface (not applicable for CLI)
# EXPOSE 8000

# Define the command to run your application
# This will be the default command when the container starts
CMD ["uv", "run", "cliper.py"]
```

## 3. Docker Compose Configuration

`docker-compose.yml` allows you to define and run multi-container Docker applications. For CLIPER, it will manage the application container, volume mounts, and environment variables.

Create a file named `docker-compose.yml` in the root of your CLIPER project:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  cliper:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    container_name: cliper_app
    environment:
      # Mount your Google Gemini API Key from your host environment
      # IMPORTANT: Replace 'your_gemini_api_key_here' with your actual key
      # or better, set it in your host's .env file and reference it here:
      # - GOOGLE_API_KEY=${GOOGLE_API_KEY}
      GOOGLE_API_KEY: "your_gemini_api_key_here"
      # Optional: Configure Whisper model size
      WHISPER_MODEL: "base"
      # Optional: Set log level for debugging
      LOG_LEVEL: "INFO"
    volumes:
      # Mount the current project directory into the container
      # This allows CLIPER to access your input videos and save outputs
      - .:/app
      # Mount a dedicated volume for WhisperX models to persist them
      # This prevents re-downloading models every time the container starts
      - cliper_whisper_models:/root/.cache/whisperx
    # If you need GPU support for WhisperX (highly recommended for performance)
    # uncomment the following lines and ensure your Docker setup supports NVIDIA GPUs
    # deploy:
    #   resources:
    #     reservations:
    #       devices:
    #         - driver: nvidia
    #           count: all
    #           capabilities: [gpu]
    # stdin_open: true # Keep stdin open for interactive CLI
    # tty: true        # Allocate a pseudo-TTY for interactive CLI

volumes:
  cliper_whisper_models:
    driver: local
```

## 4. Building and Running the Docker Container

### 4.1 Build the Docker Image

Navigate to the root of your CLIPER project in your terminal and build the Docker image:

```bash
docker-compose build
```

This command will read your `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` to create the `cliper` image. This might take some time as it installs FFmpeg and Python dependencies.

### 4.2 Run CLIPER

Once the image is built, you can run CLIPER using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose run cliper
```

This command will start the `cliper` service, execute the `CMD` defined in your `Dockerfile` (which is `uv run cliper.py`), and allow you to interact with the CLIPER CLI.

**Important Notes:**

-   **API Key**: Ensure your `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is correctly set in `docker-compose.yml` or via an `.env` file on your host.
-   **Volumes**: The `.:/app` volume mount means that any changes you make to your local project files will be reflected inside the container, and any output generated by CLIPER (e.g., in `output/`, `downloads/`, `temp/`) will appear in your local project directory.
-   **WhisperX Models**: The `cliper_whisper_models` volume ensures that WhisperX models are downloaded only once and persist across container restarts, saving time and bandwidth.
-   **Interactive CLI**: The `stdin_open: true` and `tty: true` (if uncommented) are important for interactive CLI applications like CLIPER, allowing you to provide input.

### 4.3 Running Specific Commands

You can also run specific commands within the container:

```bash
docker-compose run cliper uv run cliper.py --help
```

Or to run a specific CLIPER command:

```bash
docker-compose run cliper uv run cliper.py --download <youtube_url>
```

## 5. GPU Support (Optional, but Recommended for WhisperX)

WhisperX can be significantly faster when utilizing a GPU. To enable GPU support:

1.  **Install NVIDIA Container Toolkit**: Follow the instructions for your operating system: [NVIDIA Container Toolkit Installation Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html)
2.  **Uncomment GPU lines in `docker-compose.yml`**:
    ```yaml
        deploy:
          resources:
            reservations:
              devices:
                - driver: nvidia
                  count: all
                  capabilities: [gpu]
    ```
3.  **Rebuild the image**: `docker-compose build` (Docker will now build with NVIDIA support).
4.  **Run**: `docker-compose run cliper`

## 6. Considerations

-   **Image Size**: The Docker image might be large due to FFmpeg and Python dependencies. Consider using multi-stage builds for production environments to reduce the final image size.
-   **Security**: Be mindful of sensitive information like API keys. Using environment variables (especially from a host `.env` file) is generally better than hardcoding them in `docker-compose.yml`.
-   **Performance**: For optimal performance, especially with WhisperX, ensure you have sufficient CPU/RAM allocated to Docker, and consider enabling GPU support if available.
-   **Updates**: To update CLIPER or its dependencies, you'll need to pull the latest code, update `uv.lock` (if dependencies changed), and rebuild the Docker image (`docker-compose build`).

This setup provides a robust and reproducible environment for running CLIPER.

## 7. Sharing Your Dockerized CLIPER

There are two main ways to share your dockerized CLIPER project with others:

### 7.1 Method 1: Share via Docker Hub (Recommended)

This method allows others to pull your pre-built image without building it themselves.

**On your machine (sharing the image):**

```bash
# 1. Tag your image with your Docker Hub username
docker tag cliper_app <your-dockerhub-username>/cliper:latest

# 2. Log in to Docker Hub
docker login

# 3. Push the image to Docker Hub
docker push <your-dockerhub-username>/cliper:latest
```

**On another PC (replicating the CLI):**

```bash
# 1. Pull the image from Docker Hub
docker pull <your-dockerhub-username>/cliper:latest

# 2. Run CLIPER directly
docker run -it --rm \
  -e GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_api_key_here" \
  -v $(pwd):/app \
  -v cliper_whisper_models:/root/.cache/whisperx \
  <your-dockerhub-username>/cliper:latest
```

### 7.2 Method 2: Share Project Files (For Developers)

This method allows others to build the image from source and modify the code.

**Files to share:**
- `Dockerfile`
- `docker-compose.yml`
- `pyproject.toml`
- `.dockerignore`
- `cliper.py` and all source code
- `config/` directory (if needed)

**On another PC (replicating the CLI):**

```bash
# 1. Clone or copy the project files
# (If using git)
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd Cliper

# 2. Create a .env file or set your API key in docker-compose.yml
# Edit docker-compose.yml and replace the GOOGLE_API_KEY value

# 3. Build the Docker image
docker-compose build

# 4. Run CLIPER
docker-compose run cliper

# 5. Or run specific commands
docker-compose run cliper uv run cliper.py --help
```

### 7.3 Method 3: Export/Import Docker Image as File

Useful when you can't use Docker Hub or don't want to rebuild.

**On your machine (export the image):**

```bash
# 1. Build the image first
docker-compose build

# 2. Export the image to a tar file
docker save -o cliper-app.tar cliper_app

# 3. Share the cliper-app.tar file (will be large, ~2-3GB)
# Also share docker-compose.yml
```

**On another PC (import the image):**

```bash
# 1. Load the image from the tar file
docker load -i cliper-app.tar

# 2. Use docker-compose to run (make sure you have docker-compose.yml)
docker-compose run cliper

# Or run directly with docker
docker run -it --rm \
  -e GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_api_key_here" \
  -v $(pwd):/app \
  -v cliper_whisper_models:/root/.cache/whisperx \
  cliper_app
```

## 8. Complete Example: Setting Up CLIPER on a New PC

Here's a complete walkthrough for someone replicating your CLI tool:

### Scenario: Your colleague wants to use CLIPER on their machine

**Prerequisites on the new PC:**
- Docker installed
- Docker Compose installed

**Step 1: Get the project files**

```bash
# Option A: Clone from git
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Cliper.git
cd Cliper

# Option B: Download and extract the project zip
unzip Cliper.zip
cd Cliper
```

**Step 2: Configure API key**

```bash
# Edit docker-compose.yml and add your Google API key
# OR create a .env file:
echo "GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here" > .env

# Then update docker-compose.yml to use:
# GOOGLE_API_KEY: ${GOOGLE_API_KEY}
```

**Step 3: Build and run**

```bash
# Build the image (first time only, takes 5-10 minutes)
docker-compose build

# Run CLIPER
docker-compose run cliper

# Or run a specific command
docker-compose run cliper uv run cliper.py --download https://youtube.com/watch?v=example
```

**Step 4: Access outputs**

All generated files (videos, subtitles, etc.) will appear in your local project directories:
- `output/` - processed videos and subtitles
- `downloads/` - downloaded videos
- `temp/` - temporary files

**Step 5: GPU support (optional)**

If the new PC has an NVIDIA GPU:

```bash
# 1. Install NVIDIA Container Toolkit
# Follow: https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html

# 2. Uncomment GPU lines in docker-compose.yml (lines 28-34)

# 3. Rebuild
docker-compose build

# 4. Run with GPU acceleration
docker-compose run cliper
```

### Quick Reference Commands

```bash
# Build the image
docker-compose build

# Run CLIPER interactively
docker-compose run cliper

# Get help
docker-compose run cliper uv run cliper.py --help

# Download a video
docker-compose run cliper uv run cliper.py --download <url>

# Process local video
